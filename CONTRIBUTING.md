## Contributing
I am delighted when people want to contribute to LIME_Stratified. Here are a few things to keep in mind before sending in a pull request:
* We are now using flake8 as a style guide enforcer (I plan on adding eslint for javascript soon). Make sure your code passes the default flake8 execution.
* There must be a really good reason to change the external interfaces - I want to avoid breaking previous code as much as possible.
* If you are adding a new feature, please let me know the use case and the rationale behind how you did it (unless it's obvious)

If you want to contribute but don't know where to start, take a look at the **[issues page](https://github.com/rashidrao-pk/lime_stratified/pulls)**, or at the list below.

# Roadmap
Here are a few high level features I want to incorporate in LIME_Stratified. If you want to work incrementally in any of these, feel free to start a branch.

1. Adding Stratification concept on other data.
